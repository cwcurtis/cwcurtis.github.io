Curtis"},{"location":"about/","text":"I am an applied mathematician working in a number of problems connected to nonlinear wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and data science. I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Washington in 2009 under Bernard Deconinck . Afterwards, I performed postdoctoral work with Mark Ablowitz at CU Boulder. I joined SDSU in 2013, where I have since published a range of papers in fluids and data science, mentored quite a few students through their theses, developed MATH 340, which is a thorough introduction to using Python in mathematics, and run a semester of the PIC Math program, among other things.
