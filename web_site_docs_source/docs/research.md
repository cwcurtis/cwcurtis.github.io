## Current Work

I have a wide range of interests, and I have published recently on a range of topics including:

* Using transfer entropy to build minimal DMD models for chaotic time series (with Erik Bollt and Jay Lago): [Entropic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12062)
* Using wavelet decompositions and DMD to build predictive models of ionospheric dynamics (with Jay Lago, Katherine Zawdie, Alex Ihler): [Scale Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10215)
* Using machine learning to build adaptive, Hankel DMD based time stepping schemes to generate chaotic time series (with Erik Bollt and Jay Lago): [Hankel Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06289)
* Using machine learnig to build DMD based time stepping schemes (with Jay Lago, Opal Issan, Alex Ihler): [Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04433)
* Using the Mori-Zwanzig method to extend the DMD to include memory effects (with Jay Lago): [Optimal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02790)
* Using the DMD to study weak turbulence in the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (with Ricardo Carretero and Matteo Polimeno): [Weak Wave Turbulence](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.062215)

## Prior Work

* Developing analytical and numerical models describing the flow of vortex patches under free surface waves (with Henrik Kalisch)
* Computing particle paths in sheared flows. (with John Carter and Henrik Kalisch)
* Analyzing and modelling topological optical flows in honeycomb lattices (with Mark Ablowitz and Yi Ping Ma)
