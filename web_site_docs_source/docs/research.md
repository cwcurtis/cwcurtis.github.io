# Research

## Current Work

I have a wide range of interests, and I have published recently on a range of topics including:

* Using transfer entropy to build minimal DMD models for chaotic time series (with Erik Bollt and Jay Lago) [ERDMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12062)
* Using wavelet decompositions and DMD to build predictive models of ionospheric dynamics (with Jay Lago, Katherine Zawdie, Alex Ihler) [SSDMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10215)
* Using machine learning to build adaptive, Hankel DMD based time stepping schemes to generate chaotic time series (with Erik Bollt and Jay Lago) [DLHDMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06289)
* Using machine learnig to build DMD based time stepping schemes (with Jay Lago, Opal Issan, Alex Ihler) [DLDMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04433)
* Using the Mori-Zwanzig method to extend the DMD to include memory effects (with Jay Lago). [OptimalDMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02790)
* Using the DMD to study weak turbulence in the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (with Ricardo Carretero and Matteo Polimeno)

## Prior Work

* Developing analytical and numerical models describing the flow of vortex patches under free surface waves (with Henrik Kalisch)
* Describing particle paths in sheared flows. (with John Carter and Henrik Kalisch)
