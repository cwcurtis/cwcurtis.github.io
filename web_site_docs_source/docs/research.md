I have a wide range of interests, and I have published recently on a range of topics including

* Developing analytical and numerical models describing the flow of vortex patches under free surface waves.  (with <a href="https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Henrik.Kalisch">Henrik Kalisch</a>)
* Describing particle paths in sheared flows. (with <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/about/faculty-and-staff/john-carter-phd.html"> John Carter </a> and <a href="https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Henrik.Kalisch">Henrik Kalisch</a>)
* Using the Dynamic-Mode Decomposition to study weak turbulence in the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (with <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/"> Ricardo Carretero </a> and Matteo Polimeno)
* Using the Mori-Zwanzig method to extend the Dynamic Mode Decomposition to include memory effects (with Jay Lago).
